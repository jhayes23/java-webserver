## Description of Architecture

### Root
WebServer: Runner, initializes server and creates threads for request processing.

### *reader* Package
**ConfData:** Data object to store parsed configuration data.  

**ConfReader:** Reads and parses configuration file into ConfData object.  

**Htpassword:** Parses, encrypts, and authenticates passwords.  

**HTTPReader:** Reads http requests given a socket connection.

**MimeTypes:** Data object to store parsed mimetypes data.

**MimeTypesReader:** Reads and parses mimetype file into MimeTypes object.

**Reader:** Generic reader class for ConfReader, HTTPReader, and MimeTypesReader.

### *ResponseRequest* Package

**HTTPMessage:** Data object for creating and storing HTTP messages. Also contains classes for storing the start line of requests and responses.

**HTTPMethod:** Enum for supported HTTP request types

**RequestHandler:** Reads and parses response into HTTPMessage object, hands off to RequestProcessor to be appropriately handled, and then writes a response output.

**RequestProcessor:** Handles resolving the path, processing requests based on type, and executing scripts.

**ResponseCode:** Enum for the possible response codes the server can respond with.

**ResponseWriter:** Writes output to socket.

### *Logging* Package

**Log:** Generates and outputs to specified log file.

## Challenges

The hardest part of the project was parsing the requests and then processing them appropriately. We initially had issues with using BufferedReader to read the body of the requests. This was resolved after learning that the request body should be read byte by byte into an array.
Implementing the Execute Server Scripts functionality was also a challenge as this was a first time using anything like process-builder in java to create new processes. The lecture material on using the class was helpful in getting started.


## Testing Plan

For most of our testing, we used the provided files and curl. Curl was used to test the functionality of the HTTP request types. The provided index.html was used to test threading, authentication, and scripts.
To test classes individually, we created main methods and used sample data to test each class and their methods before integrating with the rest of the webserver.
