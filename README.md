### Code Quality (15 points)

| Completed | Points     | Description                                                             | Deductions                                                                                                                                              |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| []        | _5 points_ | Code is clean, well formatted (appropriate white space and indentation) | (-2) Minor whitespace issues (missing whitespace between logical sections, excessive whitespace, functions, occasional misalignment, run-together code)  
(-5) Major whitespace issues (inconsistent formatting, major misalignment, little use of whitespace, debug statements, inlined control flow)  
(-2) Tabs  
(-1) Failed to use explicit blocks  
(-1) Compile warning when compiling on command line  
(-1) if( expression ) return true; else return false should just return expression  
(-1) Debug output  
(-1) unused code paths (i.e. empty else block)" |
| [] | _5 points_ | Classes, methods, and variables are meaningfully named (no comments exist to explain functionality - the identifiers serve that purpose) | (-1) Unnecessary comments  
(-2) Poorly selected identifiers |
| [] | _3 points_ | Methods/Classes are small and serve a single purpose | (-1) Method is run on (contains multiple responsiblities that should have been refactored into separate functions)  
(-2) Poor class design (SRP violation, missing access modifiers, etc) |
| [] | _2 points_ | Code is well organized into a meaningful file structure | (-1) Should use packages to organize related code (i.e. config, ResponseRequest, etc.) |

| []        | _10 points_ | Description of architecture | (-2) Difficult to read - I would suggest splitting into multiple, related groups of classes to make it easier for a reader to understand  
(-2) Missing significant details (fields, methods, etc.)  
(-2) Description not clear |
| [] | _10 points_ | Challenges | (-varies) Not enough detail, no critical thinking |
